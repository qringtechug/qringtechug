# System Architecture — Q-Ring V1

## ASCII System Diagram
[Ring Sensors] → [MCU + Firmware] → [BLE] → [Mobile App (TinyML + UI)] → [Cloud (Auth, DB, ML Training, Analytics)]

## Image generation prompt (use Midjourney / DALL·E / Stable Diffusion)
"Create a clean technical system architecture diagram for a wearable smart ring project. Show layers: Ring hardware (PPG, GSR, Temp, IMU), MCU/Firmware, BLE link to Mobile App (TinyML inference, UI), Cloud backend (Auth, DB, ML Training, Analytics). Use modern, minimal flat-style icons, labeled boxes, arrows, and a soft blue / purple color palette. Include 'Q-Ring V1' title."

## Next steps:
- Replace this file with system_architecture.png when the diagram is ready.
